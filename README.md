# sib_company

"Sib" company is the leading exporter of non-oil products to different countries of the world. In order to improve the company's business performance, analyze the company's product sales data for the last few years and answer their questions.

This project is designed for you in the following five steps:
* Data pre-processing: In this part, in addition to getting to know more about the project data, we perform a series of preparation and pre-processing steps on the entire data.
* Exploration: In this step, we answer a series of high-level questions and get an intuitive view of the company's financial information.
* Studying the target markets: In the third step, we will analyze the sales and supply location and we will check in which countries despite having many customers, they experience low sales.
* Valuing customers: In this step, we introduce a practical criterion called RFM and based on this criterion, we divide the company's customers into 7 categories, each of which has its own meaning and behavior in terms of marketing.
* Analysis of customer retention: In the last step, we want to know what percentage of customers buy from this company in the following months after their first purchase.

Finally, I would like to thank [Quera](https://quera.org/) for allowing me to publish this project.
